    <!-- OK Cupid - Dating App or a Platform For Call Girls / Escorts -->
    <div class="MsoNormal">
        This article was written back in 2016...
        "This is not good, if somebody has a problem with a post then at least have the courtesy to inform/let know the author about
        it", that's what I have say to begin with and to the OK Cupid community, escorts community and call girls community.
        <br/> I am a true admirer of free and open source software, but do not know what to say about this app OK Cupid.
        <br/> Some people out there tried to benefit the society by giving it a free and good enough dating app but then the app
        lacks with a system of feedback and reporting, good user authentication system, among many other features. This allows
        users to use this app in ways not intended by its developers; one has to do more research on it to know if these
        are bugs or features. Well, now there are people, call girls and escort services who use this OK Cupid app to advertise
        themselves, as if we are already not seeing enough advertisements in the app's "hot or not" section. Now when I said
        'they advertise' they are literally advertising their phone numbers, chat application (like Skype, Kik, WeChat, etc.)
        IDs to connect via video calling or photo sharing apps later.
        <br/> The application searches for matches based on the user's location but then it uses some very stupid location management
        system and it does not even accurately predict your present location. Another bug, or feature I should say, is that
        even if you are in Delhi, it lets you change your location to well-known places by guesswork like Mumbai or Bengaluru,
        and then show you the matches from that location.
        <br/> Oh god, I hope one of the Okc developers read this.
        <br/> <span class='customTextCensorable'> To make everyone's life simple, I have a short list of contact details of those girls from the app, ping me if you need it.</span>
