<h3>EquiLeader: Find the index S such that the leaders of the sequences A[0], A[1], ..., A[S] and A[S + 1], A[S + 2], ..., A[N - 1] are the same.</h3>

A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.

The leader of this array is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of A.

An equi leader is an index S such that 0 â‰¤ S &lt; N - 1 and two sequences A[0], A[1], ..., A[S] and A[S + 1], A[S + 2], ..., A[N - 1] have leaders of the same value.

For example, given array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 3
    A[2] = 4
    A[3] = 4
    A[4] = 4
    A[5] = 2

we can find two equi leaders:

    0, because sequences: (4) and (3, 4, 4, 4, 2) have the same leader, whose value is 4.
    2, because sequences: (4, 3, 4) and (4, 4, 2) have the same leader, whose value is 4.

The goal is to count the number of equi leaders.

Write a function:

    def solution(A)

that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of equi leaders.

For example, given:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 3
    A[2] = 4
    A[3] = 4
    A[4] = 4
    A[5] = 2

the function should return 2, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

        N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [-1,000,000,000..1,000,000,000].

<h3><i>What is the core idea behind this algo?</i></h3>

<h3><i>Is it correct the equi-leaders and dominator have the same face value?</i></h3>

Yes, you are correct. In the context of this problem, the equi-leaders and the dominator have the same face value.

In the problem statement, an equi-leader is defined as an index S such that two sequences separated at index S have leaders of the same value. The leader of a sequence is defined as the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of that sequence.

Since the equi-leader is a subset of the original array, and it's defined based on having the same leader value on both sides of the split, it follows that the dominator of the equi-leader subsequence is the same as the dominator of the original array.

Therefore, in the context of this problem, the equi-leaders and the dominator indeed have the same face value.
