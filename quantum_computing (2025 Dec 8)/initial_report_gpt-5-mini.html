<b><p>Quantum computing — quick refresher</p></b>
<p>A quantum computer is a machine that uses quantum mechanics (things like superposition and entanglement) to represent and process information. Instead of ordinary bits (0 or 1), quantum bits or qubits can be in combinations of 0 and 1 at once, and qubits can become entangled so their states link together. If large-scale quantum computers become real, they could solve some problems far faster than classical machines (Shor’s algorithm for factoring is the classic example). Right now the field is still early: experiments have run on small numbers of qubits and work continues across hardware, software, theory, and applications. Many governments and military agencies fund quantum research because of potential civilian uses and security implications (like cryptanalysis). Note: without genuine quantum resources such as entanglement, experts generally think you can’t get an exponential advantage over classical computers.</p>
<p>Hardware highlights — chips, qubits and interconnects
A lot of the recent work focuses on making qubits more reliable, connecting them, and scaling up:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>New device records and materials: Researchers reported a terahertz device that sets a performance record and “opens new quantum horizons” — improvements like this can enable better control or readout of quantum states. Other work demonstrated control of triple quantum dots in a zinc oxide (ZnO) semiconductor, expanding the set of materials and device types being explored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Majorana and other processor work: Microsoft unveiled a Majorana-based processor dubbed Majorana 1. It’s being talked about as a potentially transformative step — Majorana fermions are special quasiparticles that could help reduce certain types of errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Photonics and interconnects: Photonic approaches are getting attention. There’s progress on efficient quantum process tomography (techniques to characterize quantum operations) aimed at scalable optical quantum computing. MIT researchers developed a photon-shuttling “interconnect” that enables direct communication among multiple quantum processors and facilitates remote entanglement — a key step toward distributed quantum computing. MIT also reported a fast coupling between artificial atoms and photons that could enable readout and processing of quantum information in a few nanoseconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3D chips and superconducting semiconductors: MIT teams reported new 3D chips that could make electronics faster and more energy-efficient, and work toward superconducting semiconductors that might one day replace components in quantum and high-performance computing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Corral technique and fragile states: A “corral” measurement technique was used to observe fragile quantum states in magnet–superconductor hybrid materials from a distance, which helps study sensitive quantum behavior without destroying it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Photonics, twisted light, and strong-field quantum effects <br>
Photonics (using light) keeps feeding progress: researchers advanced quantum signaling using “twisted light” (light carrying orbital angular momentum), and synchrotron radiation sources are being framed as toolboxes for quantum technologies. Studies using bright squeezed vacuum uncovered hidden quantum effects in strong-field physics, pointing to new regimes where quantum light matters for experiments and devices.</p>
<p>Networks and communications — building quantum links
Quantum networks are moving from theory to real deployments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IonQ expanded into the EU by helping establish Slovakia’s first national quantum communication network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New partnerships: New Zealand partnered with Korea on quantum communication projects, and many countries are deepening quantum ties (for example the UK and Germany committed £14 million to joint efforts).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practical hacks and products: There was a surprising demonstration where a shop-bought cable helped power two quantum networks — this highlights how some quantum testbeds can use surprisingly simple hardware in creative ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commercial products: Autocrypt announced a post-quantum PKI product for automotive OEMs (press release dated December 8, 2025), aiming to prepare vehicle systems for future cryptographic threats from quantum computers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Industry, funding and national strategies</b> <br>
Quantum is attracting money and national initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Investments and deals: Horizon Quantum raised a $110 million PIPE with IonQ among lead investors, intended to support a SPAC merger. Niobium raised more than $23 million to advance next-generation FHE hardware. Delft Circuits appointed Martin Danoesastro as CEO and extended funding. ParityQC won a contract from DLR (German Aerospace Center) to integrate quantum computing into mobility solutions. SEALSQ made a strategic investment in EeroQ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National plans and events: The “Quantum World Tour” and many international events are promoting national visions (e.g., Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Malta, Australia). The UK launched five research hubs with £100 million funding, including one in Oxford. Many countries (China, India, New Zealand, UK, Germany, etc.) are building quantum roadmaps, aiming to develop startups and scientific leadership.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Companies and software direction</b> <br>
- Quantum Source outlined engineering pathways to fault-tolerant quantum computing and promoted scalable photon–atom tech as a practical route. Microsoft researchers emphasized geometric error-correcting codes as steps toward useful applications. Startups and platforms like qBraid are making it easier for nontechnical users to access quantum devices through cloud interfaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Coverage and market watch: Reports examined “What is the price of a quantum computer in 2025?” and mapped the global quantum landscape, helping businesses and researchers plan strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Theory, algorithms and cryptography</b><br>
- New algorithms and codes: There was news about a new quantum algorithm that speeds up solving a broad class of problems, and three-way entanglement results hint at better quantum error-correcting codes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Noise and error correction: Symmetry-based simplifications of quantum noise analysis were reported, which may pave the way for better error correction. Efficient process tomography work supports scalable verification of photonic quantum processors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security implications: As quantum power grows, cryptographers are discovering new rules for quantum encryption. Coverage warned of a “Quantum Apocalypse” angle — the idea that powerful quantum machines could threaten present-day encryption (Shor’s algorithm is a core reason). In response, companies and services (for example, Apple updating iMessage) are working on future-resistant encryption strategies. There was also a warning: a new attack recently invalidated a candidate encryption algorithm, reminding us that both quantum and classical cryptography evolve quickly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Science community and recognition</b><br>
- MIT’s Quantum Initiative is growing, and MIT researchers won recognition (Lincoln Laboratory technologies won seven R&amp;D 100 Awards in 2025). MIT published many quantum-related stories in 2025, from quantum modeling for materials to device advances. Daniel Kleppner, a highly influential atomic physicist linked to quantum advances, died at 92 (July 15, 2025).</p>
<p>Big picture and timescales
Different players give different timelines. Microsoft has suggested powerful quantum machines could arrive “in years not decades,” while others urge cautious, stepwise progress. The field is broad: hardware (Majorana, superconductors, photonics), networks, error correction, algorithms, and national strategies are all moving in parallel. Phys.org, Quantum Insider, Wired, BBC, MIT News and other outlets tracked this progress — Phys.org alone reaches over 10 million monthly readers through the Science X network.</p>
<p>If you’re a student curious about quantum computing: focus on basic quantum concepts (superposition, entanglement), get comfortable with linear algebra, and follow hardware (superconducting qubits, ion traps, photonics) and software (error correction, algorithms). The field is fast-moving, international, and full of interdisciplinary opportunities — from building new chips and networks to designing the cryptography of the future.</p>
