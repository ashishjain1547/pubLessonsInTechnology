I am new to freelancing and low on budget. I am planning to set up an Agency on UpWork with two of my friends (Python backend developer and Front-end developer). UpWork charges an upfront 20 USD on monthly basis for an Agency account. 

What other costs should I plan for like the cost of connects? Answer along with monthly cost estimates. 
Also suggest what should be my bidding strategy as I would have limited connects. How can I optimize that.
