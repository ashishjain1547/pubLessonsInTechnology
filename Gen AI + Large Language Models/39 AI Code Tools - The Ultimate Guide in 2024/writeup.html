    <p>What are the best AI code tools in 2024?</p>

    <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - As of September 2024, most programmers achieve the best results by using <a
            href="https://cursor.ai/" target="_blank">Cursor</a> with <a
            href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet" target="_blank">Anthropic Sonnet 3.5</a> or <a
            href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/" target="_blank">OpenAI o1.</a></p>
            
    <p>AI coding tools are becoming standard practice for many developers. And today, you’ll learn which code generators
        &nbsp;and tools are the best ones out there for creating high-quality code with the help of artificial
        intelligence.</p>
    <p>Want to learn more? Read on!</p>
    <h3 >Is it possible to code with AI tools?</h3>
    <p>Yes, it is possible to code with AI tools. &nbsp;In fact, leveraging AI tools for coding is not only possible,
        but it can also significantly enhance <strong>productivity and accuracy.</strong></p>
    <p>AI code is code written by artificial intelligence (AI), often times utilizing large language models (LLMs).
        These AI programs can write their own programs or translate from one programming language to another. They also
        perform tasks like offering assistance in auto-generating documentation and finding code snippets faster.</p>
    <p>One of the most popular tools is Open AI’s Codex, an AI system that translates natural language to code. Codex
        powers<a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="_blank"> GitHub Copilot,</a> another popular AI code tool.</p>
    <p>OpenAI Codex is capable of interpreting simple commands in natural language and carrying them out for the
        programmer. This makes it possible to build on top of the existing application with a natural language
        interface.</p>
    <p>As a general-purpose programming model, OpenAI Codex can be applied to almost any programming task. That said,
        the tool is in beta and so results will vary.</p>
    <p>AlphaCode by DeepMind is another tool that is shaking up the industry. Interestingly, this tool outperforms human
        coders in certain situations. You see, AlphaCode outperformed <a
            href="https://www.science.org/content/article/ai-learns-write-computer-code-stunning-advance" target="_blank">45% of
            programmers</a> in coding competitions with at least 5,000 participants.</p>
    <p>However, there are problems with code generators, too. That's why AI <a
            href="https://codesubmit.io/blog/no-code-tools-for-developers/" target="_blank">coding tools</a> are used to help developers
        become more productive and efficient, rather than to replace them entirely.</p>
    <p>For example, a <a
            href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/28/code-generating-ai-can-introduce-security-vulnerabilities-study-finds/">Stanford-affiliated
            research team</a> found that engineers who use AI tools are more likely to cause security vulnerabilities in
        their apps. Plus, questions around copyright are not entirely resolved.</p>
    <p>In other words, AI code tools are not yet completely safe to use. That said, the popularity of these tools means
        that they can’t be overlooked.</p>
    <h3 >What is AI code written in?</h3>
    <p>AI code is written in languages supported by the AI code generator. For example, OpenAI Codex is most fluent in
        <a href="https://codesubmit.io/library/python" target="_blank">Python</a> but is also quite capable in several languages,
        including <a href="https://codesubmit.io/library/javascript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>, <a
            href="https://codesubmit.io/library/ruby" target="_blank">Ruby</a>, and <a
            href="https://codesubmit.io/library/typescript" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>.</p>
    <p>Now, let’s take a look at the best code generators out there.</p>
    <h2 >The best AI code generators and AI development tools
    </h2>
    <p>What are some effective AI code generators? The most popular ones include OpenAI Codex, Copilot by Github,
        &nbsp;ChatGPT by OpenAI as well as open-source models such as Llama 3.</p>
    <p>But there are plenty of other tools out there. I’ve listed them here below, including their features,
        capabilities, and which companies are behind them. Let’s dive in!</p>
    <p>Here are the best AI code generators of 2024.</p>

            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=outcGtbnMuQ" target="_blank">excels in programming tasks</a>. It understands and
        explains code, writes new code, and outperforms existing models on Python coding tasks. Despite its ability to
        handle complex tasks, it has limitations like reasoning errors and potential security vulnerabilities in the
        code it produces. &nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="https://chatgpt.com" target="_blank">ChatGPT is primarily a user-friendly interface developed by OpenAI</a> that allows
        you to interact conversationally with advanced language models like GPT-4 and o1-mini. While it's often referred
        to as a model, ChatGPT is essentially the platform that enables you to generate or debug code and perform other
        text-based tasks by communicating with these underlying AI models.</p>
    <p><strong>Update May 14th</strong>: OpenAI just releaded GPT-4o - their new flagship model that’s as smart as GPT-4
        Turbo and much more efficient. With 50% reduced pricing and 2x faster latency, it <a
            href="https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/" target="_blank">achieves impressive results.</a> </p>
    <p><strong>Update September 16th: &nbsp;</strong><a
            href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/" target="_blank">o1 is a new series of AI models</a> designed
        to enhance reasoning by spending more time thinking through problems before responding, excelling in complex
        tasks in science, coding, and math. OpenAI o1-mini is a faster, more cost-effective model particularly effective
        at coding, offering an affordable solution for applications that require reasoning but not extensive world
        knowledge. Both models are now available in ChatGPT and via the API for users to tackle complex problems
        efficiently. </p>

    <p>Meta has launched Meta AI, powered by the Llama 3 model with 70 billion parameters. &nbsp;The model positions
        itself as a powerful asset for improving application functionalities, but it does not match the customization
        and transparency of more advanced models like GPT-4 Turbo and Claude Opus. The benefits of Meta's approach to
        open-source AI are multifaceted, including attracting top talent, leveraging community contributions, fostering
        standardization and lower costs, building goodwill, and aligning with business models that do not rely solely on
        AI products. &nbsp;While it is described as "open weight," providing access to the model's weights, it does not

        library for easily authoring, fine-tuning, and experimenting with LLMs.</p>
    <p>Moreover, Meta is also currently <strong>pretraining a 405B parameter </strong>model, signaling an ambitious
        expansion of its AI capabilities. This larger model, set to be released later, promises even more powerful
        functionalities and potential industry leadership if it surpasses current leaders like GPT-4 and Claude Opus.
        Such a development could reshape industry standards and perceptions, especially against competitors who guard
        their models under the guise of safety concerns. This bold move by Meta not only showcases their commitment to
        advancing AI technology but also challenges the industry's more cautious narratives around the sharing and
