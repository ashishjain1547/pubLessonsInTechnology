<div data-v-fc0d0c5a="" class="markdown"><div class="paragraph">Picture a sunny Madrid evening, wine glasses clinking, and three Nobel laureates arguing about whether your next best friend—or boss—will be a machine. That was the <em class="">Nobel Prize Conversation</em> on “Our Future with AI,” streamed live from the Fundación Ramón Areces. Here’s the cheat-sheet for normal people.</div><hr><ol start="1"><li><div class="paragraph">Will AI steal creativity?</div></li></ol><hr><div class="paragraph"><strong>Short answer:</strong> It’s already borrowing it, but it’s not wearing the T-shirt yet.</div><ul start="1"><li><div class="paragraph">Geoffrey Hinton (the “godfather of deep learning”) showed how ChatGPT spotted that a compost heap and an atom bomb are both slow vs. fast chain reactions—an analogy most humans miss.</div></li><li><div class="paragraph">Serge Haroche (Nobel for trapping single atoms) says real creativity is driven by goose-bump curiosity, not pattern-matching.</div></li><li><div class="paragraph">The compromise: AI is like a super-fast intern who brings you wild ideas, but you still decide which ones are worth building.</div></li></ul><hr><ol start="2"><li><div class="paragraph">Quantum vs. AI: the next “weird science” team-up</div></li></ol><hr><div class="paragraph">Imagine atoms as tiny magnets that can talk to each other “in secret.” When too many join the conversation, even Einstein got dizzy.<br>Haroche’s lab now uses AI to spot patterns in that quantum chatter, cutting experiment time from weeks to hours. Translation: faster quantum computers, better drug design, weirder gadgets for your living room.</div><hr><ol start="3"><li><div class="paragraph">Can AI crack my passwords?</div></li></ol><hr><div class="paragraph">Not in a clever new way—yet.<br>María Isabel González Vasco, a crypto-math wizard, says AI just speeds up old tricks (like listening to the faint whirr of your laptop to guess your key). Her advice: keep updating your software; the <em class="">really</em> scary stuff is still quantum computers, not ChatGPT.</div><hr><ol start="4"><li><div class="paragraph">Robots in the classroom: tutor or terminator?</div></li></ol><hr><div class="paragraph">Hinton likes the idea of an AI tutor that never gets tired, adapts to every kid, and lets human teachers do the mentoring.<br>Haroche worries we’ll forget how to think if we outsource too much.<br>Consensus: blended families work—blended classrooms might too, as long as we pay teachers like we pay hedge-fund managers (spoiler: we don’t).</div><hr><ol start="5"><li><div class="paragraph">Jobs: which ones first?</div></li></ol><hr><div class="paragraph">Elastic jobs (healthcare, creative gigs) will expand—AI makes a nurse or designer 10× more productive, and we’ll simply want <em class="">more</em> care and <em>more</em> stories.<br>Elasticity-lacking jobs (call-center scripts, box-ticking) are toast.<br>Political punchline: productivity itself isn’t the enemy; who pockets the profit is.</div><hr><ol start="6"><li><div class="paragraph">How do we stop SkyNet?</div></li></ol><hr><ul start="1"><li><div class="paragraph">Tech fix? “Mechanistic interpretability” (think MRI for software) helps, but it’s early days.</div></li><li><div class="paragraph">People fix? Public pressure, same playbook as climate change: write to your politician, join a citizens’ panel, ask “Who’s liable when the algorithm goofs?”</div></li><li><div class="paragraph">Europe’s ace card: it’s a 450-million-person market—if Brussels demands “bias labels” or “energy passports” for AI, giants like Google have to listen.</div></li></ul><hr><ol start="7"><li><div class="paragraph">Should I panic?</div></li></ol><hr><div class="paragraph">Hinton’s gut: 10–20 % chance of <em class="">really</em> bad outcome (think sci-fi level).<br>Haroche’s gut: civilisation is driving toward several walls at once—climate, nukes, AI—but giving up science is the one guaranteed crash.<br>Practical takeaway: worry less about killer robots, more about dull ones that deny your mortgage because your postcode looks “risky” to the training data.</div><hr><ol start="8"><li><div class="paragraph">Three things you can do this week</div></li></ol><hr><ol start="1"><li><div class="paragraph">Treat AI like a powerful stranger: great for restaurant tips, terrible for secrets. Don’t feed it your medical records.</div></li><li><div class="paragraph">Ask your kid’s school how they use AI tutors—push for transparency.</div></li><li><div class="paragraph">Follow one AI-safety newsletter (e.g., <em>AI Policy Weekly</em>)—five minutes a week beats doom-scrolling.</div></li></ol><hr></div>

<div data-v-fc0d0c5a="" class="markdown"><ol start="9"><li><div class="paragraph">The “black-box” problem: why explaining AI is harder than building it</div></li></ol><hr><div class="paragraph">Imagine your sat-nav sends you down a goat path instead of the motorway. You can open the app and see <em>why</em>: road-works, accident, faster-time route.<br>Now imagine an AI denies your loan. The bank shrugs: “The computer says no.” That’s the black-box problem.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>What the laureates told us</strong></div><ul start="1"><li><div class="paragraph">Geoffrey Hinton is betting on “mechanistic interpretability” — basically giving the network an X-ray. Early results show individual neurons lighting up for concepts like “legal” or “DNA.”</div></li><li><div class="paragraph">María Isabel González Vasco warns that even if we spot bias, fixing it is like playing Whack-a-Mole. Delete one unfair signal and the model finds a proxy (zip code, browser type, even the font you used on your CV).</div></li><li><div class="paragraph">Serge Haroche’s physics analogy: in quantum mechanics we can’t see an electron directly, but we can measure its shadow in a cavity. Same trick is now being tried on neural nets: watch how they <em>change</em> a story when you swap a name from “Emily” to “Emilio.”</div></li></ul><div class="paragraph"><strong>Practical takeaway for non-coders</strong><br>If a company can’t explain an AI decision to you in <em>your</em> language, treat it like a used car whose engine you’re not allowed to open — walk away, or at least ask for a warranty.</div><hr><ol start="10"><li><div class="paragraph">Energy: the hidden bill we’re not paying</div></li></ol><hr><div class="paragraph">Training a big model uses roughly the same electricity as 5 000 households in a year. And that’s <em>before</em> anyone starts chatting with it.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Why the brain still wins</strong><br>Your skull runs on 20 watts — less than a fridge light. A super-computer matching one human brain needs a million times more power. Haroche jokes that evolution had a 3.5-billion-year head-start and a strict electricity budget.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>What can be done</strong></div><ul start="1"><li><div class="paragraph">Green data centres: Google and Microsoft already buy wind and solar to match <em>annual</em> consumption, but the grids still go brown on calm nights.</div></li><li><div class="paragraph">Tiny specialised chips: your phone’s AI camera runs on a sliver of silicon that does <em>one</em> job brilliantly. Expect more of those in hospitals, cars, even coffee machines.</div></li><li><div class="paragraph">Algorithmic thrift: new “pruning” methods literally snip away 90 % of the network after training, like editing a 200-page draft down to 20 without losing the plot.</div></li></ul><div class="paragraph"><strong>Personal angle</strong><br>Next time you ask ChatGPT to write a limerick, you won’t crash the planet. But if you’re a company running millions of queries an hour, the kilowatt-hours stack up fast — and investors are starting to ask why your electricity bill just overtook your coffee budget.</div><hr><ol start="11"><li><div class="paragraph">The privacy swamp: your data is the new oil, but who owns the well?</div></li></ol><hr><div class="paragraph">María Isabel shared a classroom experiment: she asked 30 computer-science students to use an AI résumé tool. Within 24 hours 12 had uploaded their full medical histories “to get better wording.” None read the terms-and-conditions.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Three creepy truths</strong></div><ol start="1"><li><div class="paragraph">Anything you type can, and probably will, be used to train the next model.</div></li><li><div class="paragraph">Even “anonymised” text leaks: postcode + rare hobby + pet name often re-identifies you.</div></li><li><div class="paragraph">Deletion requests are voluntary outside the EU, and inside the EU they can take up to 30 days — long enough for your data to be baked into a trillion-weight cake.</div></li></ol><div class="paragraph"><strong>Simple self-defence kit</strong></div><ul start="1"><li><div class="paragraph">Use the browser’s “private” mode when you experiment.</div></li><li><div class="paragraph">Strip names, addresses and numbers before you paste text.</div></li><li><div class="paragraph">If you’re an employer, add a clause: “Staff must not feed proprietary data into public AI tools without approval.” (Most Fortune-500 boards still haven’t done this.)</div></li></ul><hr><ol start="12"><li><div class="paragraph">Creativity remix — can AI be <em>original</em>?</div></li></ol><hr><div class="paragraph"><strong>The compost-heap test</strong><br>Hinton’s favourite party trick is asking, “Why is a compost heap like an atom bomb?” Most people stare blankly. GPT-4 answered: both are chain reactions where heat speeds up the process, just on different time-scales. That’s not in any textbook — it emerged from the model squeezing knowledge into fewer connections.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>But is that <em>real</em> creativity?</strong><br>Haroche says no — because the network never felt the <em>aha!</em> moment. It didn’t risk tenure, lose sleep or jump up and down when the analogy clicked.<br>Philosopher’s corner: if creativity is defined as “seeing connections that matter to <em>us</em>,” then humans still hold the steering wheel. If it’s just “produce something statistically novel,” AI is already a prolific artist.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Try it yourself</strong><br>Ask your favourite chatbot to invent a sport that could be played on Mars. Then ask it to invent the <em>rulebook, equipment list, and safety waiver</em>. You’ll get pages of plausible text in seconds. Now try to <em>play</em> the game with friends. Suddenly you’ll discover the gaps only a human body — and human humour — can spot.</div><hr><ol start="13"><li><div class="paragraph">Jobs part 2: the ones you <em>hadn’t</em> thought of losing</div></li></ol><hr><div class="paragraph">We expect taxi drivers and call-centre staff to be squeezed, but the Madrid panel flagged some surprises:</div><ul start="1"><li><div class="paragraph"><strong>Junior lawyers</strong>: discovery work (sifting millions of emails) is now 80 % faster with AI.</div></li><li><div class="paragraph"><strong>Radiographers</strong>: AI spots lung nodules better than a first-year resident; the human role shifts to comforting patients and double-checking edge cases.</div></li><li><div class="paragraph"><strong>Voice-over actors</strong>: your audiobook can be read in your favourite celebrity’s cloned voice for a few hundred dollars.</div></li><li><div class="paragraph"><strong>Code-copyists</strong>: developers who mainly glue Stack-Overflow snippets together are discovering the AI does that in milliseconds.</div></li></ul><div class="paragraph"><strong>The flip side</strong><br>New gigs are popping up: prompt engineer, model auditor, AI-ethics trainer, synthetic-data curator, “human-in-the-loop” storyteller. None existed on LinkedIn five years ago; today they’re six-figure niches.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Career advice nobody asked for</strong><br>Move upstream: ask <em>why</em> the code, the image, or the diagnosis is needed in the first place. Machines are brilliant at <em>how</em>; humans still own <em>why</em>.</div><hr><ol start="14"><li><div class="paragraph">The geopolitical chessboard</div></li></ol><hr><div class="paragraph"><strong>USA vs. China vs. Europe in one slide</strong></div><ul start="1"><li><div class="paragraph">USA: piles of venture cash, relaxed rules, “move fast, regulate later.”</div></li><li><div class="paragraph">China: gigantic data sets (1.4 billion faces), state-backed fusion of surveillance + commerce.</div></li><li><div class="paragraph">Europe: no tech giants but 450 million affluent consumers → uses market size to write the rulebook (see GDPR, now copied worldwide).</div></li></ul><div class="paragraph"><strong>What the laureates want</strong><br>Haroche: “Europe should play referee, not just striker.”<br>Hinton: “If democracies don’t coordinate, authoritarians will set the default settings for everyone.”<br>Vasco: “Privacy standards born in Brussels end up in Buenos Aires and Bangalore — let’s make them good.”</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Ordinary-person leverage</strong><br>Every time you choose a product that boasts “GDPR-grade privacy” or “EU AI-Act compliant,” you cast a vote for that rulebook. Companies track those votes with the same fervour they track clicks.</div><hr><ol start="15"><li><div class="paragraph">A day in your life, 2030 edition</div></li></ol><hr><div class="paragraph">07:00 — Your AI alarm composes a wake-up song based on your heart-rate data.<br>07:30 — Coffee machine brews a new blend invented overnight by a generative model trained on your past ratings.<br>08:15 — Autonomous bus reroutes around a street fair you didn’t know was happening; you read the summary aloud in Spanish even though you never studied it — real-time translation earbuds.<br>09:00 — Doctor’s visit: an AI has already ruled out 12 rare diseases, so the human physician spends the full 15 minutes discussing your anxiety about them.<br>12:30 — You lunch at a pop-up restaurant whose menu was created by AI to use only leftovers from yesterday’s food-delivery surplus.<br>14:00 — Work: you spend two hours “mentoring” an AI through ethical edge cases; your signature is required before it can release the new drug-recipe to regulators.<br>18:30 — You play a VR board-game set on Mars; the storyline adapts to your kid’s homework on volcanoes.<br>22:00 — Bedtime: the room lights dim in a pattern proven (on people like you) to maximise deep sleep, but you can still override with one tap.</div><div class="paragraph">Creepy or cool?

<h3>Closing thought</h3>
<div class="paragraph">As one laureate put it, “Creativity is connecting two dots that were always there, but nobody had bothered to draw the line.”<br>AI just handed us a bigger box of crayons. The picture we draw is still up to us.</div>
