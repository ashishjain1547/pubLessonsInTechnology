<b>ChatGPT powered by new GPT-5.1 will be “smarter, more conversational,” says OpenAI</b>

<i>OpenAI said that GPT‑5.1 Instant would be warmer and more conversational, while GPT‑5 Thinking would become more efficient and easier to understand</i>

OpenAI on Wednesday (November 12, 2025) announced an upgrade to its GPT-5 AI model, with the “warmer” and “more intelligent” GPT‑5.1 Instant model, and an easier to understand GPT‑5.1 Thinking model.

The company noted that GPT-5.1 Instant was its most used model, while the GPT-5.1 Thinking model was better calibrated to address both simple and complex queries, to enable both fast and slow answers based on the context.

OpenAI further said that GPT-5.1 would deliver a “smarter, more conversational ChatGPT.”

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman hailed the new releases, and pointed out how users could also customise the AI models to fit different modes and communication styles.

"GPT-5.1 is out! It’s a nice upgrade. I particularly like the improvements in instruction following, and the adaptive thinking. The intelligence and style improvements are good too,” posted Altman on X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday, adding, “Also, we’ve made it easier to customize ChatGPT. You can pick from presets (Default, Friendly, Efficient, Professional, Candid, or Quirky) or tune it yourself.”

OpenAI provided examples of the new models answering prompts and compared them to responses generated by the earlier GPT-5 model. For example, while answering a stressed-out user, GPT-5 offered relaxation tips while GPT-5.1 Instant addressed the user by name and empathised with what they had been going through in the recent past, before offering similar tips.

“For the first time, GPT‑5.1 Instant can use adaptive reasoning to decide when to think before responding to more challenging questions, resulting in more thorough and accurate answers, while still responding quickly,” said OpenAI in its blog post.

GPT-5.1 Thinking also used a similarly casual style of conversation when explaining a technical concept.

GPT‑5.1 Instant and Thinking have started rolling out to paid users (Pro, Plus, Go, Business plans) before coming to free and logged-out users. The rollout is happening gradually over the coming days, with OpenAI highlighting that it would give users sufficient notice to switch to a new model before removing an older one.

This was previously a sore point for the company when it released its GPT-5 model, with many users taking to social media to complain that they missed the older models that felt “warmer” and more “friendly.” Others were upset by a sudden upgrade in models, complaining that they did not have enough time to transfer their projects or adjust their workflow.

Altman acknowledged the criticism but flagged the often deep emotional attachments that many ChatGPT users had to specific AI models.

“GPT‑5 (Instant and Thinking) will remain available in ChatGPT under the legacy models dropdown for paid subscribers for three months, so people have time to compare and adapt at their own pace,” said the company.
