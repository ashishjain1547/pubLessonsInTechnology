<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><font color="#000000">5. CHALLENGES OF AI</font></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><font color="#000000">1. Bias and Fairness:</font></h1>
<ul>
<li>Imagine teaching a robot using old textbooks that have outdated information. If we train AI systems with biased data, they might make unfair decisions, just like a robot following outdated rules.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><font color="#000000">2. Lack of Common Sense:</font></h1>
<ul>
<li>AI doesn't have common sense like humans. It might make mistakes because it doesn't understand the world the way we do. Picture an AI trying to understand jokes or sarcasm—it's like explaining humor to a robot.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><font color="#000000">3. Needing a Lot of Data:</font></h1>
<ul>
<li>AI learns from examples, like a student learning from lots of textbooks. But, what if there aren't enough examples? AI might struggle to understand or make good decisions. It's like trying to learn a new game with only a few moves to study.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><font color="#000000">4. Explanations and Transparency:</font></h1>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, AI decisions seem like magic. Understanding why AI made a specific choice can be tough. It's like having a friend who gives you a surprising answer but can't explain how they arrived at it.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><font color="#000000">5. Security Concerns:</font></h1>
<ul>
<li>Just like protecting your computer from viruses, we need to protect AI from &quot;bad actors.&quot; If someone tricks an AI into making wrong decisions, it could have serious consequences.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><font color="#000000">6. Job Displacement Worries</font></h1>
<ul>
<li>AI is great at repetitive tasks, but some worry it might take over jobs. Picture a robot doing your homework—great for the robot, but not so great for you.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><font color="#000000">7. Ethical Dilemmas</font></h1>
<ul>
<li>Imagine an AI-powered car having to make a split-second decision in an emergency. What choice should it make? These ethical questions are like giving a robot a moral compass and hoping it makes the right call.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><font color="#000000">8. Overreliance on AI</font></h1>
<ul>
<li>Relying too much on AI can be risky. If we trust it blindly, we might forget our own skills. It's like letting a GPS guide you everywhere—you might lose the ability to find your way without it.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><font color="#000000">9. Constant Learning</font></h1>
<ul>
<li>AI needs to keep learning to stay relevant. It's like studying for a test, but the test is always changing. If AI doesn't keep up, it might become outdated and less useful.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><font color="#000000">10. Privacy Issues:</font></h1>
<ul>
<li>AI often uses a lot of personal data. If not handled carefully, it's like having someone know everything about you. We need to make sure our data is protected, just like keeping our secrets safe.</li>
</ul>
